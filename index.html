<h1> My favorite book </h1>


<h2> One Hundred Years of Solitude </h2>

<div class="wrapper">

<p>This book is written by Colombian author <strong>Gabriel García Márquez</strong>. It tells the <em>multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founded the (fictitious) town of Macondo</em>. Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude">here</a> if you are interested in this book.</p>

<p>After reading it, what impressed me the most is that Marquez can accurately and cruelly describe the different loneliness of each member in the whole family. Marquez's concept of loneliness is like "whatever you have, we are born alone". As a magical realism novel, the literary and artistic quality of this work is unparalleled.</p>
